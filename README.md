# National Charitable Organisation
Machine Learning Project

The machine learning project’s purpose is to use the results of a previous postcard mail solicitation for donations to deliver actionable insight and to improve the outcome in the next campaign. 

The machine learning project’s goal is to determine which of the individuals in the National Charitable Organisation mailing database have characteristics similar to their most profitable donors. By soliciting only these people, the Organisation can spend less money on the solicitation effort and more money on charitable concerns.
